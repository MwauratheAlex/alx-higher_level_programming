Hello there. My name is Alex Mwaura.
I work at Mbumwa.com.
I love coding.
I have no Idea where life is gonna take me in the
next few years.
I just finished Engineering school at JKUAT, and honestly,
The grades aren't that great.
I've assembled a team, and we are working,
I just don't feel it like I thought I would.

Currently catching up at ALX.
I hope to get started hacking the code interview next week,
and get a remote Job to kickstart my career. Probably the only
leverage I have right now.

I really don't want to work my entire life and retire at 60.
We are gonna do this, somehow.
I know it.
I can feel it.
